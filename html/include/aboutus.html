                    Four years between albums, and Lorde makes it sound as if all she did was party. Not that she was having much fun. On “Melodrama,” her
                    second album, Lorde’s nights out are a swirl of drunken flirtations and reckless hookups, where she tries to forget herself but ends up
                    more lonely and self-conscious than ever. Momentary pleasures lead to lasting regrets; trivial interactions can seem cataclysmic. It’s
                    an exceedingly narrow slice of life, but Lorde inhabits it with feverish intensity.The album’s opener and lead single, “Green Light,”
                    leaps right into all her conflicting impulses: She’s furious at an ex but still struggling to let go, though, she also notes, “sometimes
                    I wake up in a different bedroom.” Quick, bouncy piano chords, a foot-stomping beat and eager backup singers can only emphasize that she’s
                    “waiting for that green light” of real independence — not that she’s found it yet. But the song’s joyous major chords already sound as
                    though she’s busted loose.
